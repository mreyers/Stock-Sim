This is the beginning of a hopefully interesting stock simulation. I came across the thought recently of how a randomly divised portfolio would perform over different time periods. When I say randomly divised, I am talking about every aspect of the portfolio with only minor modifications. How many stocks should be owned? What stocks should be purchased? How much of each stock should be in the portfolio? There may be more random elements explored later, though for now I will focus on these.

Some basic assumptions and set up I will be doing for this project. First, stocks will be purchased at open on the first trading day of the year and sold at close on the last trading day of the year. There will be no opportunity to sell during the year for this simulation though I may explore the maximum possible gain/loss for each portfolio and the actual outcome.
